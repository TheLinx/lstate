h1. luaSolidState

luaSolidState (referred to as "state" from now on) is a Lua library which allows easy and painless storing of tables in Lua.

h2. How to install
Put the folder _state_ somewhere in your Lua module path. On Linux/Mac this is usually something like _/usr/local/share/lua/5.1/_ and on Windows it's _C:\Program Files\Lua\5.1\_.

h2. How to use
Take a look at this example:

bc. require("state")
-- initialize our data table
data = {aVariable = ""}
-- if there is a previous state, load it
local st = state.load("exampleStateProgram")
if st then data = st end
-- print the variable
print("Stored variable: "..data.aVariable)
-- store a new value
io.write("Input a value to be stored: ")
data.aVariable = io.read("*line")
-- save the table
state.store("exampleStateProgram", data)

Easy, isn't it?
